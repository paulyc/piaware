# FlightAware multilateration results license

FlightAware is pleased to make multilateration ("MLAT") aircraft position data
("MLAT results") available to PiAware and FlightFeeder network participants at
no cost. FlightAware invests significantly in the hardware, software and
network resources to provide this service as a benefit to users that feed
data to FlightAware. In exchange for your participation, FlightAware freely
licenses the use of the MLAT results data to you for your personal and
non-commercial use as long as you are a data feeder to FlightAware. You may use
the MLAT results in several ways:

 * Via the SkyAware web site running on your PiAware or FlightFeeder device in
   the web browser of your choice.
 * Via the JSON file output used by the SkyAware web site. (For use by advanced
   users; this is not formally supported by FlightAware.)
 * Via direct network connection to TCP port 30105 or 30106 within your local
   area network. (For use by advanced users; this is not formally supported by
   FlightAware.)

FlightAware does not allow redistribution of MLAT results data to third parties
via any means for commercial use or consumption by the general public with the
exception that you may share the SkyAware user interface with other users if you
choose. Sharing of the MLAT results data for commercial use or public
consumption in formats such as JSON, Beast, Basestation or any other format is
not permitted. Furthermore, any aggregation of FlightAware MLAT results with
other data sources is not allowed except for your personal, non-commercial
purposes.

Additionally, to maintain the quality of our data feeds and MLAT results,
feeding of any data other than Mode A/C/S or ADS-B to the FlightAware network
is not permitted. For example, you may not feed MLAT results back to
FlightAware as if it were native ADS-B data. Other data sources such as ACARS
or any data from third party sources may not be fed to FlightAware's ADS-B
network.
